Readme file for Love Wave error analysis:
In all available software for surface wave group velocity estimation the epicentral distance is divided by group travel time; although from basic theory of surface wave generation it is well known that surface waves get generated not at the epicenter, but beyond the distance of critical reflection where it is possible to get evanescent waves. Such wrong assumption may not affect group velocity estimation significantly when teleseismic events are used. However, when regional events are used there is a possibility that significant error in estimated group velocity may creep in. We tested what is the epicentral distance beyond which surface wave data can be used without introducing significant error in estimated group velocity. We also checked how phase velocity estimates may get affected if single station data is used for its estimation. A small code was developed for estimation of variation of error for different crustal and mantle velocity and density values, as well as for different period of the wave, crustal thickness, focal depth and epicentral distance values.
The code Percentage_error_calculation.m is a Matlab code where layer thickness and focal depth needs to be provided manually.
